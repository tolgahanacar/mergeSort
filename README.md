# mergeSort
Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the "Divide and Conquer" approach. It divides a large array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and merges them back together. It has a time complexity of  𝑂 ( 𝑛 log ⁡ 𝑛 ) O(nlogn) in the worst case, making it suitable for large datasets.
